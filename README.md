# Modern Research Data Portal
Simple web app framework demonstrating how to build a data portal using
the Globus [platform](https://www.globus.org/platform).

## Overview
This repository contains two separate server applications. The first, the "Portal," is an example "research portal"
that demonstrates how to authenticate users with Globus [Auth](https://docs.globus.org/api/auth/), how to make requests against the Globus [Transfer API](https://docs.globus.org/api/transfer/), and how to interact with an HTTPS-enabled Globus Endpoint. All of the Portal code can be found in the `portal/` directory.

The second application, the "Service," is an example "resource server" that demonstrates how a research portal can offload tasks to a separate service that has the capability to perform tasks on behalf of users. All of the Service code can be found in the `service/` directory.

## Getting Started
#### Set up your environment.
* [OS X](#os-x)
* [Linux](#linux-ubuntu)
* [Windows](#windows)
* [Amazon EC2](#amazon-ec2)

#### Create your own App registration for use in the Portal. 
* Visit the [Globus Developer Pages](https://developers.globus.org) to register an App.
* If this is your first time visiting the Developer Pages you'll be asked to create a Project. A Project is a way to group Apps together.
* When registering the App you'll be asked for some information, including the redirect URL and any scopes you will be requesting.
    * Redirect URL: `https://localhost:5000/authcallback` (note: if using EC2 `localhost` should be replaced with the IP address of your instance).
    * Scopes: `urn:globus:auth:scope:transfer.api.globus.org:all`, `openid`, `profile`, `email`
* After creating your App the client id and secret can be copied into this project in the following two places:
    * `portal/portal.conf` in the `PORTAL_CLIENT_ID` and `PORTAL_CLIENT_SECRET` properties.
    * `service/service.conf` where the `PORTAL_CLIENT_ID` is used to validate the access token that the Portal sends to the Service.
